#Lets start with a basic glm of time and food and time and clinical. We will also do some visualizations using a histrogram

#To do this I have to convert my date variable into a numeric variable.

```{r}
# Load necessary package
library(lubridate)

"# Sample data
mydata <- data.frame(
  date `Create date` = as.Date,
  outcome = clinical  # Yes = 1, No = 0
)"


# Recode Yes = 1, No = 0
mydata$clinical_numeric <- ifelse(mydata$clinical == "Yes", 1, 0)


# Convert date to numeric (days since first observation)
mydata$days_since_start <- as.numeric(difftime(mydata$`Create date`, min(mydata$`Create date`), units = "days"))

# Logistic regression
model <- glm(clinical_numeric ~ days_since_start, data = mydata, family = binomial)

# Model summary
summary(model)

```
